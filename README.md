<p>I'm currently a first-year PhD student at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>, advised by <a href="http://xiaolonw.github.io/"> Prof Xiaolong Wang</a>.
  Before coming to UC San Diego, I received my B.E. in Software Engineering from Nankai University in 2019
</p>
<p>I'm interested in reinforcement learning, machine learning, robotics and some system stuff. Specifically, I'd like to build intelligent agent, which make decision with information coming from different sources
